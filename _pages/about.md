Hey there! I am Junhang CHEN.

I am currently a Ph.D. Student in Information Systems at School of Management, Xiamen University, under the supervision of Prof. Xin Fu. Before that i obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree at Wuhan University of Technology.

My research focuses on (1) multi-source multi-modal data mining (i.e., text, images, videos); (2) business analytics leveraging AI and Big Data; (3) interaction and mechanism between human and AI, and then how to improve Human-AI collaboration.

Feel free to reach out to me via email for any discussion or collaboration.
