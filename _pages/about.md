Hey there! I am Junhang CHEN.

I am currently a joint PhD Student in Information Systems at Xiamen University and City University of Hong Kong. I am fortunately advised by Professor [Xin Fu](https://smr.xmu.edu.cn/TeacherWeb/Teacher_Details_2022.aspx?User_ID=537) and [Cenying (Tracy) Yang](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/People-and-Research/People/People-Details?eid=cenyyang).

My research focuses on (1) multi-source multi-modal data mining (i.e., text, images, videos); (2) business analytics leveraging AI and Big Data; (3) interaction and mechanism between human and AI, and then how to improve Human-AI collaboration.

Feel free to reach out to me via email for any discussion or collaboration.
